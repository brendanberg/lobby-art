Lobby Art
=========

Corporate office tower lobbies are not exactly the first places you think of when you want to see top-notch modern and contemporary art.
However, large corporations often have outstanding art collections and use their building lobbies and plazas as venues to display a selection of their works.
This online museum catalogs some of the highlights of corporate art collections on display in Manhattan.
